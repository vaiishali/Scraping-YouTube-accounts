# Scraping-YouTube-accounts
The question assigned is to scrape data from different YouTube accounts of our choice and compare their subscriber number. To start with the problem I have selected a channel "Bright Side" that focuses on content like interesting fun fact and mixed genre videos and another channel picked is "Fact Verse" which also makes fabulous fact videos. I have always been curious to learn. I like reading different subjects and try to learn more. With conventional book method, this is not possible as it is not practical to own every single book. So, I watch these videos which create content from a wide range of subject and are not streamline to any particular topic. In this case, individual subscriber count is calculated to determine the most popular YouTube channel among the audience. Also, to see what content interest the users. In the end, their difference is calculated.
